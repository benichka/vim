# Vim
This is my Vim installation.

**This installation is for Windows only**.

## How to install

- clone the repo;
- adapt the _\_vimrc_ file:
  - line 56: set your default working dir.

## Add the path to the system environment variables
It can be handy to have vim path in the system environment variable; that way, one can open vim or gvim simply by typing it in the CMD for instance.  
It is also simpler to integrate with Git that way.  

- Go to _Control Panel -> System and Security -> System -> Advanced system settings_;
- click the "Environment variables" button;
- in the "System variables" part, edit the "Path" variable;
- add the entry to vim executable: "\[your path\]\vim\vim81".
